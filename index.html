        <h1>The OpenApollo project</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>Open Source amateur rocket controller by TTZ engineering</h2>

        <p id="topText">OpenApollo is an open source project with the goal of making one of the most difficult parts of
            rocket design one of the easiest.

        <p id="mainText">OpenApollo [V1] is a project made to cover all possible bases of rocket design.
        With a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 SoC as the brains, it can make instananeous and resource-intensive
        calculations, all to provide the most accessible rocketry platform ever seen.<br><br>
        V 1‎ ‎ ‎ S p e c i f i c a t i o n s :<br>
        STM32F745VET6 handling sensors<br>
        BNO085 9-Dimensional IMU with accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer<br>
        MS561101BA03-50 Pressure and temperature sensor, up to 30k meters<br>
        STM32F042K6T6TR Emergency Flight Termination IC with redundant power and dedicated IO<br>
        12 Servo channels with 0.1R 2W Shunt resistors<br>
        PIC18F46K22 low-side current measurement on servos for failure detection and homing w/o switches<br>
        Seperate voltage rail for High-power pyrotechnics and Servo motors.<br>
        HC-12 433MHz module for long-range telemetry (up to multiple km with software and hardware tweaks)<br>
        NEO-M8N-0-based GPS module<br>
        Multiple available UART channels and pre-exposed I2C channels for add-on modules<br>
        High-power outputs with flyback diodes and high-current MOSFETs<br>
        OpenApollo Windows Desktop GUI for telemetry and remote control<br>
        <br>
        The largest goal of this project is to make a one size fits all solution
        to the most complicated part of rocketry by unifying guidance, navigation, control, telemetry,
        redundancy, and fault detection into a single modular and scalable system, hoping to inspire 
        people to make their move into the field of rocketry.
